<!-- USER JOURNEY -->
## User Journey
###### On the artists' side
The artist creates an account with an e-mail and password, then fills in their profile, which will include essential information such as
* Their artistic name
* A short description of their artistic approach, including the music genre they offer and examples of tracks or references
* Their hourly rate

Their profile gets enriched afterwards as customers leave reviews on the platform. The artist's profile also displays an availability calendar that is updated according to the bookings.
The artist can follow their past and future reservations on their administrator interface. When a bride & groom make a reservation request, the artist is informed and must validate or refuse the pending reservation from their interface.

###### On the groom and bride's side
The bride and groom create an account with an email and password, then are invited to fill out a questionnaire about their needs (date and place of the wedding, what style of music they are looking for, for what part of the day...). The results of their artist search are filtered accordingly. They choose an artist that interests them and can directly send a booking request, with payment of a deposit.
Once the booking is complete, the bride and groom can leave a review and a note on the artist's performance, which will then appear on their profile.
